List Virtualization

https://www.patterns.dev/vanilla/virtual-lists/

It is a technique, suppose we have 10K data in the list,but if we want to show all the data at once, 
  our webpage might got stuck because of too much data in the UI
So, we can use this "Virtualizatioin" technique, 
In this technique , we can show only those data we got fit in the View Port or our screen.


  // We can try to implement this using Intersection observer
