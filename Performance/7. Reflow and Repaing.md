# Learning Reflow and RePaint
They‚Äôre essential for understanding performance optimization in frontend development.

### üñºÔ∏è Browser Rendering Pipeline (Simplified):
- ```Parse HTML & CSS``` ‚Üí DOM & CSSOM Trees

- ```Layout (Reflow)``` ‚Üí Calculates position & size of elements

- ```Paint (Repaint)``` ‚Üí Fills in pixels (colors, borders, shadows)

- ```Composite``` ‚Üí Combines layers & renders to screen



### üü† Reflow (Layout)
***What is it?***
- Recalculating the layout (geometry) of elements in the DOM.

- Determines position, size, margins, paddings etc.

- Happens when changes affect document structure or geometry.

### Triggers of Reflow:
Triggered by:
- Adding/Removing DOM elements

- Changing element size, position, margins

- Changing font size

- Changing window size (resize events)

### Expensive?
***YES, because it can trigger recalculations for large parts of the DOM tree (especially if it's deep).***

### üü¢ Repaint

### What is it?
- Redrawing elements without recalculating layout.

- Happens when visual styles change, but geometry stays the same.


Example: ```background-color, text color, visibility, border-color changes```.


### Triggers of Repaint:
Triggered by:
- Changing colors, shadows, backgrounds

- Visibility toggles (visibility: hidden)


- Outline changes

### Expensive?
Less expensive than reflow, but still can affect performance if it happens frequently or on large areas.


### Example
```
// Triggers Reflow and Repaint
element.style.width = "500px";

// Triggers only Repaint (no geometry change)
element.style.backgroundColor = "blue";

```
