# SSG (Static site generation)

### ⚙️ In Static Site Generation (SSG):

- ✅ The pages are generated at build time, on the server (or build machine), before deployment — not per request.

- So yes — the server (build server) generates the pages, but only once, during the build process.
After that, the resulting files are just static HTML, CSS, JS, and are served directly from a CDN or static host, not from a live rendering server.
