# All about Micro-frontend
- Micro-frontend is a microservice of frontend

### Advances
1. Scalability and Reusability
2. Reliability (If any specific feature goes down it will not affect the whole app)
3. Technology Flexibility
4. Have their own pipeline

### Dis-advantage
1. Excessive coupling 
  - Excessive coupling means that your individual microfrontends depend too much on each other, directly or indirectly — defeating the whole purpose of having separate, independently deployable frontends.
2. Increase in Cost
  - More Repos
  - More pipeline
  - More teams etc



### 🧠 What is Module Federation?
Module Federation is a feature introduced in Webpack 5 that allows multiple independent builds (applications) to share code and load modules from each other at runtime.
